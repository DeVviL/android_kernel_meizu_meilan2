+ * We could use a similar algorithm to timespec_to_jiffies (with a
+ * different multiplier for usec instead of nsec). But this has a
+ * problem with rounding: we can't exactly add TICK_NSEC - 1 to the
+ * usec value, since it's not necessarily integral.
  *
- * Well, almost.  The problem here is that the real system resolution is
- * in nanoseconds and the value being converted is in micro seconds.
- * Also for some machines (those that use HZ = 1024, in-particular),
- * there is a LARGE error in the tick size in microseconds.
-
- * The solution we use is to do the rounding AFTER we convert the
- * microsecond part.  Thus the USEC_ROUND, the bits to be shifted off.
- * Instruction wise, this should cost only an additional add with carry
- * instruction above the way it was done above.
+ * We could instead round in the intermediate scaled representation
+ * (i.e. in units of 1/2^(large scale) jiffies) but that's also
+ * perilous: the scaling introduces a small positive error, which
+ * combined with a division-rounding-upward (i.e. adding 2^(scale) - 1
+ * units to the intermediate before shifting) leads to accidental
+ * overflow and overestimates.
+ *
+ * At the cost of one additional multiplication by a constant, just
+ * use the timespec implementation.
